# Submission of Idea for Code.fun.do++
## MOTIVATION
We see dozens of large scale natural disasters happening all over the world causing mass destruction of human life, manmade and natural property, it is our duty and responsibilty as a technologically advancing society to try to predict, attempt to prevent and manage support and help for the society in the case of such diasters using the up and coming fields of historical data analytics, prediction tools and modern day daily-use technologies.
## AIM
We are making an app/web-app interface that aims to cater to the populations specific to regions suffering from any natural disaster be it an earthquake, flood, tsunami or tornados. This app would have a **bi-ended approach** using an intensive rescuer and refugee side to the app and unique features adhereing to both these ends. It is our hope that using this app we could **optimise manpower** and **resource allocation** to a disaster affected societies and structure and stabilise help and rescue support to cater to those in its urgent need.  

## ASSUMPTIONS
We have to look at a set of assumptions taking into consideration our resources, availability of data and privacy of our users along with the technological limitations:
1. We need to assume that the rescuers(Government or army services, WHO, hospiatl services, refugee campers,etc.) have our app downloaded and are acquainted with the interface.
2. We also need to assume that our user end population suffering from the disaster has atleast SMS availability and has offline Google map on his device to figure out his/her location.
3. We need to assume that we have a number on which the disaster-ridden people will SMS their location such that rescuers can find them. 
4. We are assuming that shortest and safest paths can be trusted based on the live user and rescuer inputs based on moral hazards and asymmetric information transfer.
